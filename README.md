# Go.CheatRepo

This is a small "Cheat repo", I made for myself and ofcourse any one else who might find it usefull. More or less cheat sheet in repository format.

I made this because I "hate" going through long and slow tutorials / blog posts when I want to learn something new. Some times I just want a bunch of code examples that are ready to be run, that shows me exatly what stuff does.

So I went ahead and created this repository to help other people getting started with go with a bunch of code samples, showing of some of the features of Go. Below is a screenshow of the current progress of the project.

# Roadmap

* Readme files in all Subfolders for indepth descriptions
* Perhaps some comments in the code
* Youtube clip going over all the parts
* Add more parts as I learn more about Go
* Index this document with links to the different sections for quick access

I want to make a special shout-out to Jetbrains this time. Simply loved using [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) learning to code Go. Really made me feel productive, when starting out from zero Go knowledge.
