# Go.CheatRepo

This is a small "Cheat repo", I made for myself and ofcourse any one else who might find it usefull. More or less cheat sheet in repository format.

I made this because I "hate" going through long and slow tutorials / blog posts when I want to learn something new. Some times I just want a bunch of code examples that are ready to be run, that shows me exatly what stuff does.

So I went ahead and created this repository to help other people getting started with go with a bunch of code samples, showing of some of the features of Go. Below is a list of the current progress of the project.

Current Sections:

* [Array](src/Array)
* [Basics](src/Basics)
* [Cli](src/Cli)
* [Defer](src/Defer)
* [For](src/For)
* [Functions](src/Functions)
* [HelloWorld](src/HelloWorld)
* [If](src/If)
* [Imports](src/Imports)
* [Interface](src/Interface)
* [Map](src/Map)
* [Mocking](src/Mocking)
* [OnlineImports](src/OnlineImports)
* [Pointers](src/Pointers)
* [PublicPrivate](src/PublicPrivate)
* [SimpleApi](src/SimpleApi)
* [Struct](src/Struct)
* [Tests](src/Tests)
* [TypeConversions](src/TypeConversions)


# Roadmap

* Readme files in all Subfolders for indepth descriptions
* Perhaps some comments in the code
* Youtube clip going over all the parts
* Add more parts as I learn more about Go

I want to make a special shout-out to Jetbrains this time. Simply loved using [Goland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) learning to code Go. Really made me feel productive, when starting out from zero Go knowledge.
